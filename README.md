# PRODUCT-ANALYSIS-USING-POWERBI
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of data tables to extract crucial information and establish efficient connections, ensuring precise and reliable results. By developing a robust data model, I employed Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to perform insightful calculations, enabling a deeper understanding and analysis of product sales. The outcome is a user-friendly and visually engaging dashboard crafted in Power BI. This dashboard not only presents key performance indicators but also empowers stakeholders to seamlessly explore and customize their data, fostering a dynamic and intuitive experience. The project aims to provide valuable insights into product sales trends and performance metrics, facilitating informed decision-making for business stakeholders.
